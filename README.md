# Interactive Button Website

A playful and interactive website that makes it nearly impossible to say "No"! This project is built with modern web technologies and features smooth, engaging animations.

## Features

-   **Interactive "No" Button**: The "No" button playfully evades the cursor on hover.
-   **Smooth GSAP Animations**: Animations are powered by the GreenSock Animation Platform for a fluid user experience.
-   **Dynamic Gradient Background**: A beautiful, animated gradient background that adds a touch of style.
-   **Celebration Confetti**: A fun confetti explosion is triggered when the "Yes" button is clicked.
-   **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Customizable Theme**: The background colors can be easily modified using CSS variables.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 (with CSS Variables)
-   JavaScript (ES6+)
-   GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
-   Google Fonts (Nunito)

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How It Works

-   When a user hovers over the "No" button, it moves to a new random position within its container.
-   After multiple attempts to click "No," the button will shrink and eventually disappear, leaving only the "Yes" option.
-   Clicking the "Yes" button triggers a celebratory confetti animation.
-   The background features floating emojis and a gentle, animated gradient.
